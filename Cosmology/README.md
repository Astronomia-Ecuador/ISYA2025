## Course 4: Cosmology
### David Fonseca Mota (Univ. Oslo, Norway), 5 lectures

This course explores key aspects of cosmology, including the development of cosmological models, the nature of the universe's constituents, and its thermal history. It also examines observational evidence, theoretical foundations, and research frontiers in cosmology.

#### Lecture 1) The Observational Context

- Large-scale structure distribution in the universe

- The Cosmological Principle

- Hubble expansion and observational evidence

- Dark matter and its observational signatures

- Dark energy and its role in cosmic evolution

#### Lecture 2) The Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB)

- Discovery and significance of the CMB

- Physical properties: temperature, isotropy, and anisotropy

- Origin during recombination and its relation to the early universe

- Angular power spectrum and its cosmological implications
  
- CMB as a probe of:

  Density fluctuations in the early universe

  Parameters of the standard cosmological model

  Evidence for inflation and the Lambda-CDM model
